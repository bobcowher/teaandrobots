## AI & Reinforcement Learning
A deep understanding of deep learning – Mike X Cohen

This is the first course I recommend to anyone trying to get into AI. Mike Cohen covers a full deep dive that lets you learn, through bite-sized concepts and experimentation, how to learn and optimize models.

neuralnet.ai – Phil Tabor

This is less a specific course than a specific author. Phil Tabor takes a “papers to code” approach, teaching the student how to take a research paper and turn it into a final project. I find Phil’s approach here incredibly useful, but also very advanced. You’ll get the most out of these if you think of it as an advanced college course, with a similar level of effort invested.
